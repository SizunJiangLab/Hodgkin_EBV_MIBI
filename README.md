# Hodgkin EBV MIBI


Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) is a tumor composed of rare Reed-Sternberg (RS) tumor cells nested within a tumor microenvironment (TME) consisting of extensive but ineffective immune infiltrates. cHL is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) that is consistently found in almost 50% of all cases, but how EBV contributes to the pathogenesis of cHL remains largely unknown. We applied multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) spatial proteomics on 6 EBV-positive and 14 EBV-negative cHL samples and identified TME features that distinguish EBV-positive from EBV-negative cHL TME, including the predominance of memory CD8 T cells and significant upregulation of immune exhaustion features. We also identified EBV presence and CD8 T cell enriched cellular neighborhoods as factors that promote immune exhaustion, which we found is a tumor-intrinsic feature dependent on the spatial proximity to RS tumor cells. Our findings are orthogonally validated through GeoMx spatial transcriptomics applied on a larger cohort of 22 EBV-positive and 24 EBV-negative cHL samples, where we further describe the unexpected expression of EBV latent and lytic transcripts that potentially modulate tumor proliferation and contrasting chemokine signatures that may differently impact T cell chemotaxis. (one more sentence for figure 6). To our knowledge, these findings provide the first comprehensive descriptions of EBV-linked reorganization and immune evasion of the cHL TME, and further underlie a potential need for virus-dependent therapeutic strategies against cHL and beyond.
